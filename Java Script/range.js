function printRange(start, end, skip) {

    if ( skip == undefined) {

        skip = 1;

    }

    //note to self: this is how i make it so if the user does not pass a skip amount I would use this parameter to fix it. in a later version of javascript withint the function definition i could write "funtion printRange(start, end, skip = 1)" and then it would default to that

    if (end == undefined){

        end = start;

        start = 0;

        //note to self: does not work for negative numbers, returns NaN, find out what to put to make it work for a negative number

    }

    if (start < end) {

        for ( var i = start; i < end; i+=skip) {

            console.log(i);

    }

    }
